## Application Introduction

###### General Description:

- Mobile app that serves as a content manager for projects that contain ethnographic data. The app also contains the tools to recollect ethnographic data such as: images, video, audio and text files. The data stored in each project can be accessed from the app and the administrator has the ability to add participants to the project. The app contains a friendship mechanism that will allow administrators to add participants to their projects.

###### Purpose of the System: 

- Acquire a platform where investigators can share resources of text and multimedia with users that have access to the project.

###### Systems Reach:

- Users: The users can look and send friend requests, view their friends and accept or reject friend requests. They can also create projects, that will make them administrators of a project and participate in other users’ projects.

- Administrators: Users who create the project can add and view the ethnographic data on their project. They also can add users to their project. 

- Participants of a Project: They can view and add ethnographic data.
