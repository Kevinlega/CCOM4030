## Introduction

###### General Description:

- Mobil app that serves as a content manager for projects that contain ethnographic data. The app also contains the tools to recollect ethnographic data such as: images, video, audio and text files. The data stored in each project can be accessed from the app and the administrator has the ability to add participants to the project. Users will also have friends for them to not have to write the email of the user they want to add to the project. 

###### Purpose of the System: 

- Acquire a platform where investigators can share recourses of text and multimedia with users which have access to the projects data.

###### Systems Reach:

- Users: The users can look and send friend request, view their friends and accept or reject friend request. They can also create projects which makes them administrators and participate in other users’ projects.

- Administrators: Users who create the project can add and view the ethnographic data on their project. They also can add users to their project. 

- Participants of a Project: They can view and add ethnographic data.
